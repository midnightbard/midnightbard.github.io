title: The Hidden History of Tarot - From Forbidden Symbolism to Mainstream Magic

## **The Deck That Captured the World’s Imagination**


But the **story of tarot’s rise** is anything but simple. It begins not with a fortune-teller’s crystal ball, but with secret symbols, coded messages, and centuries of political and religious tension. This is the tale of how a forbidden set of images journeyed from occult societies into your local coffee shop.

## **Tarot’s True Origins: Not What Most People Think**

One of the most persistent myths is that tarot originated in ancient Egypt as a “Book of Thoth” passed down through secret initiations. While this makes for a compelling mystical narrative, historians have yet to find concrete evidence linking tarot directly to Egyptian temples.

Instead, the **earliest confirmed tarot decks** appeared in **15th-century Italy**, not as tools of divination but as lavish playing cards called _carte da trionfi_ — “cards of triumph.” Commissioned by wealthy families like the Visconti and Sforza, these decks featured allegorical images celebrating virtues, moral lessons, and the grandeur of their patrons.

## **From Plaything to Portal: The Esoteric Turn**

So how did a game for nobles become a tool for unlocking the secrets of the universe?

The shift began in the **late 18th century**, when French occultists like **Jean-Baptiste Alliette (Etteilla)** and **Antoine Court de Gébelin** declared that tarot imagery hid ancient mystical wisdom. Court de Gébelin, after examining a deck, claimed the images contained Egyptian priestly knowledge encoded in symbols.

Etteilla took this further:

- Reordered the cards to fit his divinatory system.
    
- Associated them with astrology, numerology, and the four classical elements.
    
- Published one of the first comprehensive tarot reading manuals.
    

From that moment, tarot was no longer just a card game — it was a **spiritual technology**.

## **The Role of Forbidden Symbolism**

In an era when open practice of esoteric arts could invite suspicion or persecution, tarot’s imagery served as a **camouflaged code**. Hidden within the art were:

- **Astrological correspondences** disguised as decorative motifs.
    
- **Alchemical processes** depicted through metaphor.
    
- **Kabbalistic references** embedded in the sequence of the Major Arcana.
    

For example:

- The **Fool** — often portrayed with a small satchel — was seen as the initiate carrying secret wisdom.
    
- The **Tower** — a crumbling structure — became an image of both divine judgment and spiritual awakening through destruction.
    
- The **World** — with a central figure encircled by a wreath — mirrored sacred mandalas and the concept of cosmic unity.
    

To the uninitiated, these were charming illustrations. To the initiated, they were an **esoteric curriculum**.

## **Tarot and the Occult Revival**

By the 19th century, Europe was in the midst of an **occult revival**. Secret societies like the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn wove tarot into their systems of ritual magic and mystical study.

Members of the Golden Dawn — notably **Arthur Edward Waite** and **Pamela Colman Smith** — created the now-iconic **Rider–Waite–Smith deck** (1909). This deck:

- Introduced full pictorial scenes to the Minor Arcana, making intuitive reading easier.
    
- Retained esoteric correspondences in colors, symbols, and compositions.
    
- Spread widely thanks to the mass printing capabilities of the early 20th century.
    

This was a turning point: tarot was no longer the guarded tool of a select few — it was in the hands of the public.

## **From Taboo to Trend: Tarot in the Modern Era**

For much of the 20th century, tarot was still viewed with suspicion by religious authorities and dismissed as superstition by academics. In some countries, fortune-telling was regulated or outright banned.

Then came the **counterculture movement of the 1960s and 70s**, which embraced tarot as:

- A **tool of self-discovery** aligned with the human potential movement.
    
- A **symbol of rebellion** against rigid religious and social norms.
    
- A **portable piece of art** with limitless potential for reinterpretation.
    

By the 1990s and early 2000s, tarot found its way into:

- **Therapy rooms** (as a tool for guided reflection)
    
- **Art communities** (with decks created by contemporary artists)
    
- **Pop culture** (appearing in films, TV shows, and music videos)

## **The Symbolism That Survives**

Despite tarot’s mainstreaming, its **layered symbolism** remains potent. The Major Arcana — the 22 “trump” cards — still tell the **Fool’s Journey**, an archetypal story of spiritual awakening:

1. Innocence (The Fool)
    
2. Learning (The Magician, The High Priestess)
    
3. Trials (The Tower, Death)
    
4. Integration (The Star, The World)
    

These symbols work on multiple levels:

- **Conscious mind** — providing narrative and imagery.
    
- **Subconscious mind** — triggering archetypal recognition.
    
- **Energetic/spiritual** — serving as portals for meditation and ritual.

## **Tarot as a Mirror, Not a Fortune Machine**

One of the most significant modern shifts is the understanding that tarot **doesn’t dictate the future** — it reflects the present. Rather than predicting an unchangeable destiny, tarot reveals:

- Hidden patterns in thought and behavior.
    
- Subconscious desires or fears.
    
- Potential outcomes based on current energy.
    

This reframing has made tarot far more acceptable to mainstream audiences, positioning it as a **tool for empowerment rather than fatalism**.

---

## **Why the Hidden History Matters**

In a world where tarot is sold in chain bookstores and featured in lifestyle magazines, it’s easy to forget its journey — from **courtly entertainment**, to **occult codebook**, to **countercultural emblem**, to **therapeutic artform**.

Remembering its hidden history:

- Honors the generations of practitioners who kept the tradition alive under threat.
    
- Reminds us that its images are **multilayered cultural artifacts**, not just pretty pictures.
    
- Deepens our appreciation for the deck as a bridge between the mystical and the everyday.

## **Practicing Tarot with Historical Awareness**

If you want to bring the richness of tarot’s past into your own practice:

1. **Study historical decks** like the Visconti–Sforza, Marseille, and early Rider–Waite–Smith.
    
2. **Learn the symbolic languages** it draws from — astrology, Kabbalah, alchemy, Christian mysticism.
    
3. **Acknowledge its cultural journey** in your readings, weaving history into your interpretations.
    
4. **Experiment with both traditional spreads and intuitive pulls**, blending old and new.

## **Conclusion: A Deck That Holds Many Worlds**

Tarot has been a game, a secret code, a mystical map, a rebel’s emblem, and now, a mainstream tool for self-understanding. Its resilience lies in its adaptability — and in the way its symbols speak to universal human experiences.

The next time you shuffle a deck, remember: you’re holding centuries of art, politics, magic, and human longing in your hands. Beneath the modern gloss, the forbidden symbolism still hums — ready to reveal itself to those who know how to look.
