        <b>A few stuff about home server, intranet and social media scheduler</b><br/>

    <p>I revamped a discarded PC and installed LAMP on it. It is a home server, which means no hosting online due to the nature of my connection ( mobile) but I can build it into anything for personal use.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A LAMP server is a popular open-source web development platform that combines four key components: <strong>L</strong>inux, <strong>A</strong>pache, <strong>M</strong>ySQL, and <strong>P</strong>HP. It provides a complete and reliable environment for hosting websites and web applications. The four components work together to deliver web content: Linux as the operating system, Apache as the web server, MySQL for database management, and PHP for server-side scripting.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Years ago I worked on WordPress so I installed that and Piwigo. Personally I think WordPress is enough due to extensive plugins and options.</p>

<p>The only thing it missed, to be an absolute solution for my in-house tool for me and my team - is a social media post scheduler. All available tools were either paid or limited, and most of them donâ€™t have all networks I am interested to include into our project.</p>

<p>So, I built that part on my own, and for now it schedules posts for Bluesky, Mastodon, Threads, Tumblr and Discord.</p>

<p>The hardest part to make was Threads; Meta programming ( Facebook ) significantly changed from the time I was working on it.</p>

<p>Anyways I created a working program for other four in a day, and the next day I needed to learn and figure out how Threads suppose to work.</p>

<p>I needed an extra day to polish a front end design, adjust it to mobile template, and to install additional scripts for extra features - buttons, calendar, draft posts and some quirks etc etc.</p>

<p>Today the whole thing had a fall-out because of the unstable network conditions and glitches due to - I guess - solar flares. They reported we had five in a row and that it MIGHT disrupt some things.</p>

<p>That was a great opportunity to install additional safety measurements, so that cron doesnâ€™t fall out of a key, and all of it works smoothly and without glitches.</p>

<p>Glitches will happen , because this is a server side website and Rune ( my neighbour who is a social media manager) is using it on a home connection.</p>

<p>Yes, I established a sort of a intranet, and yes my team already asked if it can host games and other, more profound tools, like 3D modellingâ€¦</p>

<p>Rune used to work with Buffer and he was used to have a database of drafts, so I built an additional page for that as well, with search, colour coded networks, edits â€¦ etcâ€¦</p>

<p>Buffer also has a calendar view, so I made an extra widget with that too.</p>

<p>Anyways, an app is very simple and this is how it looks like ( for now):</p>

<h4 id="calendar-view">Calendar view</h4>

<h4 id="drafts">Drafts</h4>

<hr />

<p>I will make sure that all this works smoothly, and then additionally probably some time next month I will upgrade it for TikTok and Pinterest.</p>
