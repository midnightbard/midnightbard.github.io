        <b>nothing much</b><br/>

    <p><em>Mystery, Action &amp; Adventure, Drama</em></p>

<p>Just to give the shortest possible intro - I binged this within a few short weeks, because series is leaving Netflix and I wanted to know how it ends.</p>

<p>I think this would be more fitting to the <em>Opinion</em> category than movies, because I will not ruin your fun by exposing details, so no spoiler alert necessary.</p>

<p>In my opinion the first season was great, the rest is a slow-burn torture.</p>

<p>I dislike two of a few main characters, Kate Austen and Jack Shephard so much that I gave them names such as Insect and Parasite, though there were few worse.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/dXaDrlU.png" class="img-thumbnail" /></p>

<p>Just to inform you, this goes on for <strong>118</strong> episodes.</p>

<p>The only characters that gave me any hope and any entertainment were James Sawyer and John Locke, and this has nothing to do with actors.

<hr />

<p>Immediately after this endless torture was over - thankfully in a record time - I jumped into a few episodes of a new season of Wednesday ( which is pale BTW) and I am also watching Colony - which was cancelled, of course - which is NOT on Netflix, of course - which by the way canâ€™t hold me attention, eyelids up or story arc for dear lifeâ€¦ of course.</p>
