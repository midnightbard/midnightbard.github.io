_Mystery, Action & Adventure, Drama_

Just to give the shortest possible intro - I binged this within a few short weeks, because series is leaving Netflix and I wanted to know how it ends.

I think this would be more fitting to the _Opinion_ category than movies, because I will not ruin your fun by exposing details, so no spoiler alert necessary.

In my opinion the first season was great, the rest is a slow-burn torture.

I dislike two of a few main characters, Kate Austen and Jack Shephard so much that I gave them names such as Insect and Parasite, though there were few worse.

Just to inform you, this goes on for **118** episodes.

The only characters that gave me any hope and any entertainment were James Sawyer and John Locke, and this has nothing to do with actors.

Immediately after this endless torture was over - thankfully in a record time - I jumped into a few episodes of a new season of Wednesday ( which is pale BTW) and I am also watching Colony - which was cancelled, of course - which is NOT on Netflix, of course - which by the way can't hold me attention, eyelids up or story arc for dear life... of course.
