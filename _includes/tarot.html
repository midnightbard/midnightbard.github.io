All about tarot cards and readings<br/>

Tarot is a powerful tool for insight, reflection, and guidance. It’s made up of 78 cards filled with rich symbolism, stories, and archetypes. People use tarot to explore life’s questions, understand their emotions, and gain perspective on challenges or decisions. The cards don’t tell the future in a fixed way — instead, they act like a mirror, helping you see patterns and possibilities. Each reading is a blend of intuition, card meanings, and the reader’s interpretation. Whether you’re new to tarot or have been using it for years, working with the cards can be a deeply personal and creative experience. From daily pulls to full spreads, tarot invites you to connect with your inner wisdom and look at your life from a fresh angle.<hr/>
