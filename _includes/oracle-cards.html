<b>Information about oracle decks and usage</b><br/>
Oracle cards are similar to tarot but with more flexibility in structure and style. A deck can have any number of cards and cover almost any theme — angels, animals, affirmations, or nature. Unlike tarot, which follows a set system, each oracle deck is unique, with its own meanings and messages. People use oracle cards for inspiration, reflection, and gentle guidance. They’re often more straightforward and easy for beginners to pick up, but still powerful for experienced readers. Drawing a card can feel like getting a personal note from the universe, offering encouragement, clarity, or a new perspective. Oracle cards are a versatile and creative way to connect with your intuition and explore your spiritual path.<hr/>
