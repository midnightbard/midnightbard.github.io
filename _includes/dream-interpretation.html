<b>Analyzing dreams and their meanings.</b><br/>

Dream interpretation is the art of exploring what your dreams might mean. From ancient times to modern psychology, people have believed that dreams can offer guidance, reveal hidden feelings, or connect us to the spiritual world. Some dreams are vivid and strange, while others feel so real they stay with you for days. Symbols in dreams — like flying, falling, or meeting certain animals — can carry personal or universal meanings. While no dream dictionary can tell you exactly what your dream means, exploring the themes and emotions in it can help you understand yourself better. For many, dream interpretation is a mix of self-reflection, storytelling, and intuition. It’s like decoding a personal message from your subconscious, offering clues to your hopes, fears, and life path.<hr/>
