Various tarot card spreads and layouts

<br/>

A tarot spread is the pattern or layout in which you place the cards during a reading. Each position in the spread has a specific meaning â€” for example, past influences, current challenges, or possible outcomes. Some spreads are simple, like a single card draw or a three-card spread, while others are more complex, like the Celtic Cross. Choosing the right spread can help you focus your reading and gain deeper insights. You can use classic spreads or create your own to suit your question or mood. Spreads act as a map for your reading, guiding how you interpret the flow of messages from the cards. Over time, you may find certain spreads work best for specific types of questions or themes.<hr/>
