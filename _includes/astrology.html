    Astrology is the study of how the positions and movements of planets and stars might influence people and events on Earth. It’s built on the idea that the cosmos and human life are connected. Your birth chart, based on the date, time, and place you were born, maps out where the planets were at that moment — and astrologers believe this can reveal insights into your personality, relationships, and life path. Astrology goes beyond daily horoscopes; it can explore cycles, challenges, and opportunities throughout your life. While some see it as symbolic guidance and others as entertainment, many people find astrology helps them reflect on themselves in new ways. Whether you’re curious about your sun sign or fascinated by the deeper layers of planetary patterns, astrology is a way of looking at life through a cosmic lens.
