Energy centers and chakra balancing<br/>

Chakras are energy centres in the body, each linked to different physical, emotional, and spiritual aspects of life. The idea comes from ancient Indian traditions, which describe seven main chakras aligned along the spine, from the base to the crown of the head. Each chakra has its own colour, element, and theme — like the heart chakra for love and compassion or the throat chakra for communication. When energy flows freely through the chakras, it’s believed to support balance and well-being. But if a chakra is blocked or overactive, it can affect how you feel or function. Practices like meditation, yoga, sound therapy, and crystal work are often used to balance chakras. Learning about them can be a powerful way to understand yourself and bring harmony to mind, body, and spirit.<hr/>
