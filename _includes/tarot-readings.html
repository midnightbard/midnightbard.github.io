Guides and live tarot readings<br/>


A tarot reading is a conversation between you, the cards, and your intuition. In a reading, cards are drawn and placed into a layout or “spread,” each carrying a meaning shaped by its position and surrounding cards. A reading might explore your current situation, offer advice, or highlight hidden influences. It’s not about predicting a fixed future — it’s about uncovering insights and perspectives you might not see on your own. Some readings are quick, using just one or three cards, while others are more in-depth, covering different aspects of life. Whether you read for yourself or work with a professional, a tarot reading can feel like a guided journey through your thoughts, feelings, and possibilities.<hr/>
