Meditation is a practice of focusing your mind to achieve a state of calm, clarity, or awareness. It can be as simple as paying attention to your breath or as structured as following guided visualizations. People meditate for many reasons — to reduce stress, improve concentration, or deepen spiritual connection. While there are many styles, the core idea is to be present in the moment and gently bring your attention back when it wanders. Meditation has been practiced for thousands of years in various cultures and spiritual traditions, but it’s also widely used today for mental and emotional well-being. Even just a few minutes a day can help you feel more centered and balanced. Over time, meditation can train your mind to respond to life with more calm and less reactivity.<hr/>
