<b>Reiki, crystal healing, and other energy work.</b>

Energy healing is based on the idea that the body has a natural flow of energy that can be balanced and restored for better health. This energy is sometimes called “life force,” “chi,” or “prana.” When this flow is blocked or disrupted, it’s believed to cause physical, emotional, or spiritual issues. Practices like Reiki, crystal healing, and chakra balancing aim to clear these blocks and encourage the body’s natural healing abilities. Energy healers may use their hands, specific tools, or even sound and light to shift energy. Whether you see it as a spiritual practice or a form of relaxation, many people find it calming, soothing, and deeply restorative. Energy healing encourages you to slow down, tune in, and reconnect with yourself — helping you feel more balanced inside and out.<hr/>
