<b>Practices and tips for mindfulness and awareness</b><br/>

Mindfulness is the practice of paying full attention to the present moment without judgment. It’s about noticing what’s happening — in your mind, body, and surroundings — without getting caught up in thoughts about the past or future. You can be mindful while meditating, walking, eating, or doing everyday tasks. By slowing down and observing without criticism, you create space to respond instead of react. Mindfulness has roots in Buddhist traditions but is now used in many secular settings to reduce stress, improve focus, and support emotional well-being. Practicing mindfulness regularly can help you feel calmer, more aware, and more connected to yourself and others. It’s a simple concept, but it can transform how you experience daily life, making even ordinary moments feel richer and more meaningful.<hr/>
