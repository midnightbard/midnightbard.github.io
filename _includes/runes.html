Runes are ancient symbols that were once part of writing systems in Northern Europe, especially among the Norse and Germanic peoples. Today, they’re often used for divination and spiritual insight. A set of runes usually includes 24 stones or pieces marked with characters from the runic alphabet, plus sometimes a blank stone. In readings, runes are drawn or cast, and each symbol carries meanings linked to nature, life events, or spiritual lessons. Rune reading combines history, symbolism, and intuition to explore questions or situations. Some people also use runes in magical work, engraving them into objects for protection, luck, or guidance. Holding and working with runes connects you to a tradition that’s both ancient and deeply rooted in nature and myth.<hr/>
