Shadow work is the process of exploring the hidden parts of yourself — the thoughts, feelings, and habits you might avoid or deny. It’s not always easy, but it can be deeply healing. Journaling is a powerful way to do this work, giving you a safe space to reflect and uncover truths. Together, shadow work and journaling help you better understand yourself and grow in authenticity.<hr/>
