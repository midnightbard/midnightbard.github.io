<b>Methods of divination including runes pendulums and more</b><br/>

Divination is all about looking for signs, patterns, or messages to understand the past, present, or future. People have practiced it for thousands of years in many different cultures. From reading tarot cards to tossing coins, gazing into crystal balls, or even watching the way smoke moves — there are endless ways people try to connect with hidden knowledge.

Some see divination as a spiritual tool, a way to receive guidance from the universe, spirits, or their own intuition. Others enjoy it simply as an art or tradition.

The key is that divination isn’t about telling the future with perfect accuracy — it’s about insight, reflection, and sometimes inspiration. It can help you think about your life in new ways and see possibilities you might not have noticed.
