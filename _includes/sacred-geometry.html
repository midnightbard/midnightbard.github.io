Sacred geometry is the study of shapes and patterns that are believed to have special meaning or reflect the hidden order of the universe. From the spiral of a seashell to the symmetry of a snowflake, these patterns show up in nature, art, and architecture all around the world. Ancient cultures used sacred geometry in temples, monuments, and spiritual art, believing the shapes could connect people to higher truths or cosmic energy. Common examples include the Flower of Life, Metatron’s Cube, and the Golden Ratio. For some, these shapes are more than just beautiful — they’re keys to understanding how everything is connected. Whether you see them as spiritual symbols, mathematical wonders, or both, sacred geometry invites you to look at the world with new eyes and notice the hidden patterns woven into everything.<hr/>
