Nature therapy is the practice of using time in natural settings to promote healing and well-being. Whether itâ€™s walking in the forest, sitting by the ocean, or tending a garden, nature can reduce stress, improve mood, and spark creativity. It reminds us to slow down, breathe, and reconnect with the world around us.<hr/>
