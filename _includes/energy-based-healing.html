Energy-based healing works with the body’s natural energy systems to restore balance and well-being. Practices like Reiki, crystal healing, or chakra balancing aim to clear blockages and encourage healthy energy flow. Many people find these methods soothing, uplifting, and deeply restorative. Even if it’s subtle, energy work can leave you feeling lighter, calmer, and more connected.<hr/>
