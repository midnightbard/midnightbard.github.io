Meaning of spiritual and tarot symbols<br/>

Symbols are like little pictures that carry big meanings. In tarot, each card’s imagery tells a story and hints at deeper truths. In spiritual traditions, symbols can represent ideas like protection, transformation, or connection with the divine. Cultural symbols — like flags, animals, or colors — carry shared meanings within a group. Archetypal symbols, found in myths and dreams, tap into patterns we all share as humans, like the “hero,” the “mother,” or the “trickster.” Learning about symbols can help you understand stories, art, and even your own inner world in a richer way. They act like bridges between the visible and invisible, the known and the mysterious. Once you start noticing them, you’ll see symbols everywhere — in books, films, everyday objects, and even nature itself.<hr/>
